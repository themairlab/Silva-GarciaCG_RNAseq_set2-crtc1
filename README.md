RNAseq Analysis: CRTC-1 downstream of set-2 long-lived mutant

## DESCRIPTION
- set-2 mutants which are deficient in the trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3) live longer than WT animals (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28379943). We found that the Co-transcription factor CRTC-1 blocks this long-lived phenotype. set-2;crtc-1 double mutants show a normal lifespan. We want to identify what targets are regulated by CRTC-1 in order to promote longevity in set-2 mutant animals.
- Conditions: All strains were grown on OP50-1, then bleach and seed EV plates with the embryos. After 3 days, animals were collected at day 1 of adulthood.
